# Phase 1

## Green Thumb
The idea is an Android/iOS mobile application that functions as a gardening assistant. The app will utilize the full functionality of a modern smartphone to enable even the most green (pun intended) gardener to start and maintain a beautiful home garden, whatever that home may look like. The need for increased urban biodiversity is clear. Converting concrete to greenspace and monoculture lawns to diverse gardens promotes the health of bee populations, takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, and helps keep cities cool (literally). We already see a trend in this direction with new office towers and condos covered in trees and some cities replacing parking lots with parks. However, many more regular citizens will need to participate for this trend to make an impact. But keeping plants alive is not always so easy for the inexperienced, which is where Green Thumb comes in. The app will use the phone’s location data to determine the range of appropriate plants based on temperature, sunshine, and rainfall which is further refined by the answers to a few simple questions to the user, such as area available for planting and the orientation of the garden for sunshine. The user can select the desired plants from this range and the app will provide instructions on how to plant and even provide links for the purchase of the plants and needed extras (soil, watering can, plant food, etc.). Helpful instructional videos and friendly reminders to water will ensure that an amateur gardener can’t go wrong. 

## Groceries
The idea is a grocery list app that will find the cheapest store to buy from. While it may be tempting to choose convenience over price the bill for groceries is unarguably one of the largest costs for household budgets. Yet with more and more retailers offering online shopping people shouldn’t have to choose between convenience and price, then again not everyone has the time to scour each grocers website and find the best price. “Groceries” solves the last hurdle to convenience by searching the online sites of grocers and creating an easily accessible compendium of price matching and comparisons thus allowing  users to quickly and effortlessly determine the best place to buy the products they need most at the best price. 

## Screen Time Control
This is an Android/iOS mobile app that gives parents control over kids screen time remotely. Parents have been trying hard to restrict the amount of time kids spend on their digital devices since kids are getting more and more addicted to electronic devices, but can’t always be present to police their childrens screentime. The study of National Institutes of Health has shown that brain changes among kids using screens more than seven hours a day lead to lower cognitive skills compared to those using screens for more than two hours a day. The purpose of this app is to give you an easy and effective way to keep track of their screen usage.  Parents can remotely link to any of the registered devices that their children use, such as their smartphones, tablets and even the home TV or computer, and allows them not only monitor what they are doing with their cell phone, but also set a time limit on certain apps or even blocking them. It also allows you to locate your kids so that you can see their location on the map. Access to the devices can be manually toggled at any time through the controlling users phone or schedules for access which will be automatically enforced can be set in advance. 
Balancing on screen time is becoming a difficult task not only for young kids, but also adults. If you are someone who has addiction spending time on social media, watching videos or playing video games. This app also provides you a chance to use as a time management tool with someone you trust, for example your family, girl/boyfriend etc.

# Phase 2

In phase 2 we conducted research about the idea that we settled on, Green Thumb.
